Konni-chiwa,
I am Aman Raj pursuing my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Mandi. I have keen interest in Computers and how they work. I also love to develop softwares and websites. My love for development can be seen from my latest hobby project. The project is an online event platform where we can conduct quizzes. It is an responsive and progressive web app which is built in NODEJs. This project has a content management system as well which is developed using MongoDB. Login and security has been ensured by using Google Authentication. This is a full stack project where I developed the front end as well as backend for the app. My hobbies include playing basketball, guitar and travelling. Currently I am the captain of IIT Mandi basketball team and have represented IIT Mandi at national level in basketball.
